# Fresh start
## What
New codebase that shares same concepts with my [previous codebase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_tree_(artificial_intelligence,_robotics_and_control)). This one is being developed and tested on my local server<br>My ABSOLUTE-script is still working and being maintained on official server
## Why
My previous codebase is being hard to expand so I decided to start from scratch so I can create more modular system mainly by using [Behaviour Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_tree_(artificial_intelligence,_robotics_and_control))
